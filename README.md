# Holonomic-Art-Bot
Allocated theme for E-yantra Robotics Competition 2022-2023

Cities, by nature, are constantly under development. In the future, the process of achieving the ever-demanding upgrades in the infrastructure of a city will be automated. The impact of such automation can lead to lesser construction time, little to no manual labour and lower execution costs. With more time, energy and finance to spare, this automation will be empowered by technology and imagination of the mind, and leave room for artistic expression.

Humans have an inherent need to make sense of the world around them, understand it and then create something new out of it. For a more inclusive city, this is even more true. Demarcations on the road, signage on billboards and bus stops, and well-landscaped gardens provide order to the chaos and create an environment where the inhabitants can connect to their primal need to belong.

Keeping the above scenario in mind, in eYRC 2022-23 we present the theme HolA Bot (HB)! HolA Bot is short for Holonomic Art Bot. As the full name suggests, this theme will have two major components to it: Holonomic Drive Bot and Art!

In this theme, the teams will build a HolA Bot for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City. To enable the robot to do more complex art, the teams will explore an exciting type of mobile locomotion, known as Holonomic Drive. Unlike the usual, more popular differential drive robots**, the holonomic drive robots can control all the three degrees of freedom possible on a plane (translation along the x, y-axis and rotation along the z-axis). This gives the robot the ability to make art that would otherwise not be possible with the usual two-wheeled differential drive robot.

**The Differential Drive Robot (Non-holonomic system) has non-holonomic constraints that prevent direct control of translation in one axis
